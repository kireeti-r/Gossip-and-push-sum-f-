What is working: Convergence of both Gossip and Push sum algorithms when nodes are connected in line, full, 3D and imp3D topology.
What is the largest network you managed to deal with for each type oftopology and algorithm:
We have managed to implement all the topologies for both algorithms with 10K nodes.
